# Hotel_Booking_System

In this coursework we have developed an extensible object-oriented data structure
for managing bookings for hotels, restaurants, and rickshaw taxis. 
Part of the code, the inheritance hierarchy, the class Booking, the class 
Coursework2Main and the class HasFixedPrice were already given.
My task was to complete the rest of the classes so that they implement the desired
functionalities using suitable object-oriented concepts and information hiding. 
This includes adding attributes, constructors, and (abstract or concrete) methods 
to the provided classes. I was required to carry this out without modifying the 
initially given complete clases. 

Functionality described in documantation.
This is an IntelliJ project. JDK 11.04 was used.
